# ðŸ”§ Google Cloud Deployment Fix Strategy

## Issue Summary
The deployed Cloud Run service shows a white page because API endpoints return HTML instead of JSON.

## Root Cause
The production static file serving uses a catch-all route `app.use("*", ...)` that intercepts API requests.

## Applied Fix
Created `server/static-handler.ts` with corrected routing that excludes API routes from static file serving.

## Current Deployment Status
- **Build in Progress**: Cloud Build is creating new image with fix
- **Expected Resolution**: 3-5 minutes for new deployment
- **Alternative**: Environment variable update attempted

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test API endpoint (should return JSON)
curl "https://techpartner-site-flxd6wf2jq-uc.a.run.app/api/health"

# Should return: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","service":"TechPartner Platform"}
```

## Expected Outcome
Once the fix is deployed:
- API endpoints will return proper JSON responses
- React app will load correctly
- Landing page will display properly
- All features will function as expected

## Manual Verification Steps
1. Visit https://techpartner-site-flxd6wf2jq-uc.a.run.app/
2. Should see TechPartner landing page with hero section
3. API health check should return JSON response
4. All navigation and features should work
