# Manual Push Instructions

## Current Status ✅

Your database integration is **ALREADY WORKING**:
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/categories` returning all 8 services
- ✅ Database integration active with SAR pricing  
- ✅ Health endpoint responding: `{"status":"healthy","platform":"TechPartner Platform - Production"}`
- ✅ Server running enhanced platform with PostgreSQL

## Git Lock Issue

Replit has git locks preventing automatic push. You need to push manually.

## Manual Push Steps

**Option 1: Use Replit Git Panel**
1. Click the **Git** tab in Replit sidebar
2. Click **"Push to origin"** button
3. This will push your 26 commits to GitHub

**Option 2: Terminal Commands**
```bash
# In Replit shell (may need multiple attempts)
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy database integration via CI/CD"
git push origin main
```

**Option 3: Force Push (if needed)**
```bash
git push -f origin main
```

## What Happens After Push

1. **GitHub receives your 26 commits** with database integration
2. **Google Cloud Build trigger activates** automatically 
3. **CI/CD deploys enhanced platform** to VM 34.69.69.182
4. **Zero-downtime deployment** replaces current server

## Current Platform Status

Your enhanced TechPartner platform is running with:
- PostgreSQL database integration ✅
- JWT authentication system ✅  
- All 8 service categories ✅
- SAR pricing system ✅
- Production health monitoring ✅

## Verification

After pushing, verify deployment at:
- **Platform**: http://34.69.69.182
- **API Health**: http://34.69.69.182/api/health
- **Services**: http://34.69.69.182/api/categories

Your database integration work is complete and running! Just need to push to GitHub to trigger final CI/CD deployment.
