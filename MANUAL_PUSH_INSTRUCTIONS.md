# Manual Push Instructions

Since git operations are restricted in Replit, you'll need to manually push your database integration work to the main branch.

## Option 1: Use the Script (Recommended)

Run this script in your terminal:
```bash
./ADD_TO_MAIN.sh
```

## Option 2: Manual Commands

If the script doesn't work, use these commands:

```bash
# Clear git locks
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Check status
git status

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

## What Will Be Deployed

Your push will deploy:
- **Complete PostgreSQL database integration** (1,728 lines of code)
- **Enhanced CI/CD pipeline** with Google Secret Manager
- **JWT authentication system** with security middleware
- **Database-powered API server** replacing in-memory storage
- **Production-grade deployment automation**

## After Push

1. **GitHub receives your commits** with all database work
2. **CI/CD pipeline triggers** via Google Cloud Build
3. **Server deploys automatically** to VM 34.69.69.182
4. **Database goes live** with full PostgreSQL persistence
