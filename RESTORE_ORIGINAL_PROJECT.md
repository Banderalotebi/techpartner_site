# Restore Original TechPartner Project

## Issue Found
- Original project exists at `/home/bander/techpartner_site` ✅
- All source files are intact (client/, server/, shared/) ✅  
- Build files are missing in `/dist/` directory ❌
- Package.json shows "rest-express@1.0.0" indicating full project ✅

## Quick Fix Commands
Run these on your VM to restore the working TechPartner platform:

```bash
cd /home/bander/techpartner_site

# Check current status
ls -la dist/

# Build the complete project (this creates dist/index.js)
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start

# Alternative: Use PM2 for production
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --name techpartner-platform
pm2 save
```

## Expected Result
Your complete TechPartner Studio platform will be restored with:
- All original React components
- Professional landing page
- Service categories
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Original TechPartner designs

The project structure is intact - just needs to be built.
