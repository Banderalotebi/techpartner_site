# üéØ Final Google Cloud Deployment Solution

## Current Issue
- Google Cloud Run deployment shows white page
- API endpoints return HTML instead of JSON
- Static file handler intercepting API routes

## Immediate Action Required

Since the Cloud Build process is encountering delays, here's the **fastest solution**:

### Option 1: Grant Google Cloud Permissions (5 minutes)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=glossy-agency-448211-s4)
2. Find `replit-deployer@glossy-agency-448211-s4.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Add these roles:
   - **Cloud Build Editor** (`roles/cloudbuild.builds.editor`)
   - **Artifact Registry Writer** (`roles/artifactregistry.writer`)
   - **App Engine Admin** (`roles/appengine.appAdmin`)

This will allow me to deploy the fixed version properly.

### Option 2: Use Replit Deploy (2 minutes)
- Click "Deploy" button in Replit interface
- Choose "Autoscale" deployment
- Platform will be live immediately at `.replit.app` URL

## Current Platform Status
‚úÖ **Local Development**: Perfect - complete landing page working
‚úÖ **All Features**: Ready - admin dashboard, questionnaires, authentication
‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Fixed - static handler corrected for production
‚è≥ **Google Cloud**: Needs permission update or alternative deployment

## Technical Fix Applied
Created `server/static-handler.ts` that properly excludes API routes from static file serving. This resolves the white page issue once deployed.

## Recommendation
**Use Option 1 (permissions)** if you want Google Cloud specifically, or **Option 2 (Replit Deploy)** for immediate working deployment.
