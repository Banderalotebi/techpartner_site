- **User Requirement**: Deploy exact original TechPartner platform with no layout changes
- **Build Status**: In progress (complex build with many assets)

- **8 service categories** with SAR pricing exactly as built
- **Complete API endpoints** with original functionality
- **Portfolio and blog pages** with all content

## Next Steps:

2. Build will complete with all original assets (5-10 minutes)
3. Original platform files will be uploaded to VM
4. Platform will be accessible with exact same appearance

## Expected Timeline:
- **VM Ready**: 2-3 minutes
