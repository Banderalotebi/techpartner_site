# 🔄 TechPartner Auto-Sync System

## ✅ SYSTEM ACTIVATED

Your TechPartner platform now has complete automatic GitHub synchronization enabled. Any changes made in Replit or your local environment will automatically sync with GitHub.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Activate Auto-Sync
```bash
./start-auto-sync.sh          # Setup and start auto-sync system
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
./auto-sync-watch.sh          # Continuous monitoring (recommended)
./smart-sync.sh               # One-time intelligent sync
./quick-push.sh "message"     # Fast commit and push
./conflict-check.sh           # Check for potential conflicts
```

### Node.js Sync (Alternative)
```bash
node scripts/github-sync.js sync     # One-time sync
node scripts/github-sync.js watch    # Continuous monitoring
node scripts/github-sync.js status   # Repository status
```

- Maximum 20 auto-commits per hour
- Intelligent commit batching
- Conflict detection before operations
- Graceful error handling

## 🔍 Status Monitoring

### Check Sync Status
```bash
./conflict-check.sh           # Detailed repository analysis
node scripts/github-sync.js status  # Current sync state
```

### View Sync Logs
```bash
git log --oneline -10         # Recent commits
cat .last-sync               # Last sync timestamp
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No git repository"**
```bash
git init
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
```

**"Permission denied"**
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

**"Merge conflicts"**
```bash
./smart-sync.sh              # Automatic conflict resolution
```

**"Push failed"**
```bash
./sync-from-remote.sh        # Pull first, then push
./quick-push.sh
```
