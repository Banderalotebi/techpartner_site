# Simple Fix Commands

The dist/ directory is missing. Run these commands:

cd /home/bander/techpartner_site

# Build the project to create dist/
npm run build

# Check if dist/ was created
ls -la dist/

# Start the server on port 80
sudo PORT=80 NODE_ENV=production npm start

# Alternative: Check what ports are in use
sudo ss -tlnp | grep :80

# If build fails, check what's in package.json
cat package.json
