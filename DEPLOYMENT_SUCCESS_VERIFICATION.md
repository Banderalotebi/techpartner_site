# TechPartner Platform Deployment Verification

## Status Update
- **VM IP**: 35.226.175.178
- **Current Task**: Deploying your exact original TechPartner platform
- **User Requirement**: No layout changes, exact same website

## Deployment Issues Identified:
1. **Build Process**: Taking longer than expected due to large asset files
2. **VM Initialization**: Server starting but not fully accessible yet
3. **File Transfer**: Need to complete build before uploading original files

## Next Steps:
1. Complete the build process with all original assets
2. Package your exact platform files 
3. Upload to VM replacing placeholder content
4. Verify your original design is working exactly as built

## What Will Be Deployed:
- Your exact TechPartner homepage with hero section
- All 8 service categories exactly as designed
- Complete questionnaire flows (6-step logo, 5-step web design, 8-step development)
- Original styling, fonts, colors, and animations
- All your custom React components and API endpoints
- SAR pricing system and portfolio sections

## Expected Timeline:
- Build completion: 5-10 minutes
- File upload to VM: 2-3 minutes
- Platform verification: 1-2 minutes
- **Total**: 10-15 minutes for complete deployment

The VM is ready and waiting for your original platform files. Once the build completes, your exact website will be deployed without any changes to the layout or design.
