   ```

2. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/main/vm-deploy-script.sh | bash
   ```

3. **Or deploy manually**:
   ```bash
   # Backup current file
   sudo cp /var/www/html/index.html /var/www/html/index.html.backup
   
   # Replace with TechPartner platform
   sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
   # Delete all content and paste the complete code from COMPLETE_PLATFORM_CODE.html
   
   # Reload nginx
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

## Result
After deployment, http://34.69.69.182 will show:
- ✅ TechPartner Studio (instead of placeholder)
