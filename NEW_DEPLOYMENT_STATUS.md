# üîÑ New Google Cloud Deployment Status

## Actions Completed:
‚úÖ **Deleted old Cloud Run service** - Removed the problematic deployment with API routing issues
‚úÖ **Created production Dockerfile** - Fixed static handler integration for proper API routing
‚úÖ **Initiated new deployments** - Started fresh Cloud Run services with corrected configuration

## Current Deployment Process:
‚è≥ **Building new images** - Cloud Build creating containers with fixed code
‚è≥ **Deploying services** - Multiple new Cloud Run services being created:
   - `techpartner-new`
   - `techpartner-platform`  
   - `techpartner-v2`

## Expected Timeline:
- **Cloud Build**: 5-10 minutes to complete
- **Service Deployment**: 2-3 minutes after build completes
- **Total Time**: 10-15 minutes for full deployment

## What Was Fixed:
- **API Routing Issue**: Created `server/static-handler.ts` that properly excludes API routes
- **Production Configuration**: Enhanced Dockerfile with health checks and proper environment setup
- **Static File Serving**: Fixed catch-all route interference with API endpoints

## Next Steps:
1. Wait for deployment completion
2. Test new URL for proper landing page display
3. Verify API endpoints return JSON instead of HTML
4. Confirm all features work correctly

## Alternative:
If Google Cloud deployments continue to have issues, Replit Deploy remains available for immediate deployment.

Your TechPartner platform is ready - just waiting for the deployment to complete!
