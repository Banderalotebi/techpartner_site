# Clean Deployment Fix

Starting fresh with proper project structure and deployment.

## Step 1: Clean VM and Prepare Fresh Upload

```bash
# On VM - Clean existing deployment
sudo rm -rf /opt/techpartner
sudo mkdir -p /opt/techpartner
sudo chown bander:bander /opt/techpartner
```

## Step 2: Create Complete Deployment Package

We'll create a clean deployment package with:
- Complete source code with correct paths
- Production-ready build configuration
- Proper Google Cloud port setup (80/8080)
- Database integration with Neon PostgreSQL
- All original TechPartner design elements

## Step 3: Upload and Deploy

Fresh upload with correct project structure and immediate deployment on standard web ports.

This ensures clean deployment without any path conflicts or residual configuration issues.
