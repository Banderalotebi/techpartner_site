# Clean Deployment Fix

The git reset worked but caused directory corruption. Here's how to fix it:

## Step 1: Navigate to Parent Directory
```bash
cd /home/bander/techpartner_site
pwd
ls -la
```

## Step 2: Clean Deploy Your Database Integration
```bash
# Remove corrupted directory
rm -rf techpartner_site

# Clone fresh with your database integration
git clone https://github.com/Banderalotebi/techpartner_site.git techpartner_site

# Navigate to new clean directory
cd techpartner_site
```

## Step 3: Install and Deploy
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Stop old PM2 processes
pm2 delete all

# Start your database-powered server
pm2 start server/index.js --name "techpartner-site"

# Check status
pm2 status
pm2 logs
```

## Step 4: Verify Database Integration
```bash
# Test enhanced API
curl localhost:3000/api/health
curl localhost:5000/api/health

# Verify you have latest database code
git log --oneline -3
```

The reset command successfully pulled your database integration, but corrupted the working directory. This clean deployment will give you a fresh start with all your PostgreSQL features.
