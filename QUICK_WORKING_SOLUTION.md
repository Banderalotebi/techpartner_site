# Quick Working Solution

## Issue Identified
The project path confusion:
- VM deployment attempts were at `/opt/techpartner` (wrong path)
- Your actual working project is at `/home/bander/techpartner_site/techpartner_site`
- Your original TechPartner platform was working fine before

## Solution: Restore Original Working Project

Check what happened to your original project:

```bash
cd /home/bander/techpartner_site/techpartner_site

# Check if files are still there
ls -la

# Check if server is running
ps aux | grep node

# Check what's in package.json
cat package.json

# If project files exist, simply restart the original server
npm install
npm run build
npm start

# Or if using PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 status
```

## Alternative: Quick Fix
If the original files are corrupted, deploy the React frontend to the correct path:

```bash
cd /home/bander/techpartner_site/techpartner_site

# Stop any running processes
sudo pkill -f node
pm2 delete all

# Deploy React frontend here (same commands as before but correct path)
```

## Expected Result
Your original TechPartner platform should work again at the correct project path with all original designs intact.

The `/opt/techpartner` path was incorrect - your working project has always been at `/home/bander/techpartner_site/techpartner_site`.
