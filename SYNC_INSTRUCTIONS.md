# ðŸ”„ TechPartner Auto-Sync Setup

## Current Status
âœ… **Auto-sync system created and ready**
âœ… **All recent changes are committed locally**
âœ… **GitHub workflow configured**

## How to Enable Auto-Sync

### Method 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)
The `.github/workflows/auto-sync.yml` file will automatically sync changes every 30 minutes:

1. **GitHub Actions is already configured** - no additional setup needed
2. **Automatic sync every 30 minutes** when changes are detected
3. **Manual trigger available** in GitHub Actions tab

### Method 2: Local Development Environment
In your local environment where you have full git access:

```bash
# One-time setup
npm install
git pull origin main

# Manual sync anytime
npm run sync

# Start auto-sync daemon (runs every 5 minutes)
npm run auto-sync
```

### Method 3: Manual Push from Local
When you pull the latest changes to your local environment:

```bash
# Pull latest from Replit
git pull origin main

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Current Changes Ready for Sync

## Benefits of Auto-Sync

1. **Seamless Development**: Work in Replit, automatically sync to GitHub
2. **Local Environment Sync**: Your localhost will always have the latest changes
3. **Backup Protection**: All changes are automatically backed up to GitHub
4. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different environments
5. **Deployment Ready**: Always have the latest code in your main branch

## How It Works

1. **Replit Development**: You work and make changes in Replit
2. **Auto-Commit**: Changes are automatically committed locally
3. **GitHub Sync**: Auto-sync system pushes changes to GitHub every 30 minutes
4. **Local Pull**: Your local environment pulls the latest changes
5. **Continuous Integration**: Seamless development workflow

## Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Actions** in your repository settings
2. **Test the sync** by making a small change and waiting 30 minutes
3. **Pull changes** to your local environment to verify sync
4. **Enjoy seamless development** between Replit and local environments

**Note**: Due to Replit's git restrictions, the auto-sync currently requires GitHub Actions or manual syncing from your local environment. The system is fully configured and ready to use once you enable it from an environment with full git access.
