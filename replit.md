- `GET /api/packages/:id` - Get specific package details
- `POST /api/project-briefs` - Submit project requirements
- `POST /api/quiz-responses` - Submit brand quiz responses

### Frontend Components
- **ServiceCategories**: Interactive category selection grid
- **ServicePackages**: Package browsing with filtering
- **ProjectQuestionnaireModal**: Detailed project brief collection
- **BrandQuizModal**: Brand assessment questionnaire
- **Header/Footer**: Navigation and branding components

## Data Flow

1. **Category Selection**: Users browse service categories displayed in a responsive grid
2. **Package Discovery**: Packages are filtered based on selected category or displayed in full
3. **Project Brief**: Users select packages and fill detailed project questionnaires
4. **Brand Quiz**: Optional quiz provides personalized service recommendations
5. **Data Persistence**: All user inputs are stored in PostgreSQL via API endpoints
6. **Real-time Updates**: TanStack Query manages cache invalidation and updates

## External Dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite development server with Express.js backend
- Hot module replacement for React components
- Automatic TypeScript compilation
- Database migrations via Drizzle Kit

### Production Build
- Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- ESBuild compiles Express.js server to `dist/index.js`
- Static assets served from Express.js in production
- PostgreSQL connection via environment variables

### Environment Configuration
- `NODE_ENV` controls development vs production behavior
